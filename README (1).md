## 📘 Project Description

This project is a comprehensive data analysis and visualization of the Nobel Prize dataset. It aims to uncover historical trends and patterns related to Nobel Prize laureates across categories like Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, Literature, Peace, and Economics.

Using Python and libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project performs in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on various aspects such as:
- Country-wise distribution of Nobel Prizes
- Gender representation among winners
- Age demographics at the time of winning
- Year-wise and category-wise trends

Interactive and static visualizations provide insights into how the Nobel landscape has evolved over time. The project is documented in a clean and structured Jupyter Notebook, making it suitable for educational use, portfolio building, and demonstrating data storytelling skills.
